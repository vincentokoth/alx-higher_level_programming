# Python - if/else, loops, functions.
## Tasks :spiral_notepad: 
#### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
[0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py): This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed.
* The `variable` number will store a different value every time you will run this program
* The output of the program should be:
	* The number, followed by:
		* if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
		* if the number is 0: `is zero`
		* if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
	* followed by a new line

[1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py): This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed.
* The variable `number` will store a different value every time you will run this program
* The output of the program should be:
	* The string `Last digit of`, followed by:
	* the number, followed by:
	* the string `is`, followed by the last digit of `number`, followed by:
		* if the last digit is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
		* if the last digit is 0: the string `and is 0`
		* if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
	* followed by a new line

[2-print_alphabet.py](./2-print_alphabet.py): A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line:
* using only one `print` function with string format
* Using only use one loop
* Without storing any characters in a variable or importing any modules

[3-print_alphabt.py](./3-print_alphabt.py): A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
* Printing all the letters except `q` and `e`
* using only one `print` function with string format
* Using only one loop
* Without storing any character in a variable or importing any module

[4-print_hexa.py](./4-print_hexa.py): A program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal.
* Using only one `print' function with string format
* Using only use one loop in your code
* Without storing numbers or strings in a variable or importing any module

[5-print_comb2.py](./5-print_comb2.py): A program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
* Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
* The last number should be followed by a new line
* The program can only use no more than `2` print functions with string format
* The progam can only use one loop in your code
* The program connat store numbers or strings in a variable or import and module

[6-print_comb3.py](./6-print_comb3.py): A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
* Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
* The two digits must be different
* `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`
* The program must print only the smallest combination of two digits
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
* The last number should be followed by a new line
* The program:
	* can only use no more than 3 print functions with string format
	* can only use no more than 2 loops in your code
	* cannot store numbers or strings in a variable or import any module
