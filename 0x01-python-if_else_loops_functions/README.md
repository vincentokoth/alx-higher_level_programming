[0-positive_or_negative.py](https://github.com/vincentokoth/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py): This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
* The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
* The output of the program should be:
	* The number, followed by:
		* if the number is greater than 0: is positive
		* if the number is 0: is zero
		* if the number is less than 0: is negative
	* followed by a new line

[1-last_digit.py](https://github.com/vincentokoth/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/1-last_digit.py): This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
* The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
* The output of the program should be:
	* The string Last digit of, followed by:
	* the number, followed by:
	* the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by:
		* if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
		* if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
		* if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
	* followed by a new line
